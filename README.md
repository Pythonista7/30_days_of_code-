# 30 Days of Code Challenge

### About

- 30 days of code chalenge is ment to get the programmer in you running.

- Commit to a minimum of 1 hour a day of coding to sharpen your skills.

- No language restrctions.

- No topic restriction.But make make sure to keep it challenging.

- Additional description appriciated but not mandatory.

- *Descriptive comments, indentation and sensible variable names are a must.*

- Commit code + log(output) to github every 24 hours for the next 30 days.

- Don't Forget to update this Readme everyday.


## Resources
Don't know where to begin?

1) Try solving coding challenges on websites like :

	Codewars : [www.codewars.com/r/4NSWPQ](www.codewars.com/r/4NSWPQ) (Relatively Easy)

	Or tons of other challenging ones.To mention a few :

	- Hacker Earth -[https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

	- Hacker Rank - [https://www.hackerearth.com/](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

	- CodeChef - [https://www.codechef.com/](https://www.codechef.com/)


2) Try to implement basic **Datastructes** and **Algorithms** initially and   	move on to apply to other problems.

3) Move on to neich corners.Want to learn something new and specific goahead.
But make sure you putdown a meaning effort and upload anything you've written.
***Dont miss a commit just because it ain't great.***
4) Or start early and obtain the art of learning from documentation>will help you in the long run.<br>
### Day 1
* Insertion Sort in C.(Algorithms)
	* Code file - [InsertionSort.c](https://github.com/Pythonista7/30_days_of_code-/blob/master/InsertionSort.c)
	* Log File - [InsertionSort_log.txt](https://github.com/Pythonista7/30_days_of_code-/blob/master/InsertionSort_log.txt)



* A Basic Clone of MS Paint using OpenCV in Python.(ImageProcessing)
	* Code file - [PaintBrushwCV.py](https://github.com/Pythonista7/30_days_of_code-/blob/master/PaintBrushwCV.py)
	* A sample below:

### Day 2
* Core Operations with openCV.I would highly recommend checking out the openCV documentation.They also a really good python tutorial.Click [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0).Topics covered today Core Operation: Basic Operations , Arithmetic and Bitwise operations.
	* Code File : [OCVCoreOps.py
](https://github.com/Pythonista7/30_days_of_code-/blob/master/OCVCoreOps.py)
	* Screen Shot :

### Day 3
* Today I was really curious to apply this to one of my [Other Project](https://github.com/Pythonista7/Sign_Language_Digit_Recognition).I've always wanted to do this.The prediciton acc might not be good but I learnt a lot of things about pipelining video data and other challenges.

	* Code File : [SignLangDigitRecogWOpenCV.ipynb](https://github.com/Pythonista7/30_days_of_code-/blob/master/SignLangDigitRecogWOpenCV.ipynb)
	* Screen Shot :

The "mask" window is rescaled to input to the CNN("img" is the input to the CNN) and the mask overlayed with the prediction of what the hand-posture is, is show displayed on the top right of the "result" window.
